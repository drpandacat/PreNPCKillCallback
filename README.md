Uses
    - Called before an NPC is killed by damage
    - Passes info on the damage that would kill an entity, including the damage source
    - Return true to prevent kill, false to prevent incoming damage that would kill. Useful for custom enemy death sequences, provides`frozen` argument passed to dictate whether or not enemy death effects should take place.
    Why this over a simple damage amount and `HitPoints` check?
    - `HitPoints` is only updated the frame after damage is taken, meaning that this check will fail if the sum of multiple instances of damage taken in a single frame is greather than or equal to the entity's `HitPoints` while none of the parts alone are. Commonly seen with multishot items.
    Parameters:
    - npc `EntityNPC`
    - source `EntityRef`
    - frozen `boolean`
    - amt `number`
    - flags `DamageFlag`
    - cooldown `integer`
    Optional argument `EntityType`
```lua
Isaac:AddCallback(PRE_NPC_KILL.ID, function (_, npc, source, frozen, amt, flags, cooldown)
    print("Hi")
end)
```
